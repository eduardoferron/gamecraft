# gamecraft
This is a fork from jdah/minecracft-again repository. With time, this is going to become an engine for a future game.

Thank you, jdah!

Use the `Makefile` (`$ make`) to build (make **sure** you clone with submodules!). This won't support any platforms other than Mac OS, you'll need to modify `platform_glfw.cpp` yourself to add support.

PLEASE NOTE, this is just some experiment I'll be running so I will not be supporting it, adding new platforms, fixing bugs, or anything like that - but feel free to browse :)
